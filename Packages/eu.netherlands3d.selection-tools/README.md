# Selection Tools
Tools to draw areas and make selections

## Installing

This package is provided through OpenUPM, to install it using the CLI you can perform the following:

```bash
$ openupm add selection-tools
```

or, you have to add `https://package.openupm.com` as a scoped registry with, at least, the following scopes:

- `eu.netherlands3d`

## Usage
See samples package for examples. This needs the main Netherlands3D package because it still makes use of the event system. This will be fixed in a future release
