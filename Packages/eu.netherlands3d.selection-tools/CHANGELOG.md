## [2.5.0]

### Added

- selectionAreaBounds event in AreaSelection that is triggered whenever the selection area is (re)drawn while in the 
  process of selecting an area

## [2.4.0]

### Added

- Added SetCurrentInputPointsWithoutNotify() method to override current list of positions without invoking edit or create events

## [2.3.0]

### Added

- Made some fields and methods extendable, added property to set world plane.

## [2.2.4]

### Fixed

- Fixed problem where dragging the end point of an open polygon (line) would also move the first point to the end position.
- When performing the closing action with less than the minimum required points, a point is added at the cursor position to attempt to create a valid shape.

## [2.2.3]

### Fixed

- Used SetDrawMode when finishing a polygon to update pointer visibility

## [2.2.2]

### Fixed

- Fixed execution order issue where another system may disable the input action map of this system. By default the input action map will be enabled and no longer disabled to avoid interfering with other systems that may use the same input action map.

## [2.2.1]

### Fixed

- Auto draw is now disabled in edit mode

### Added

- Separated Package from Netherlands 3D. Still has dependency on Netherlands 3D (core and Poly2Mesh) this will be removed in the next update

## [1.0.1]

### Fixed

- Removed dependency on Netherlands3D.Core. The extension methods used are added in a temporary script that should be removed when possible to avoid double code.

## [1.1.0]

### Added

- Unity functions are now overridable
- Added overridable function to calculate position to be added. 

### Fixed

- Fixed incorrect function calls with CloseLoop and FinishPolygon.
- Renamed some variables for clarity 
- MinPointDistance is now calculated based on handle size for spherical handles
