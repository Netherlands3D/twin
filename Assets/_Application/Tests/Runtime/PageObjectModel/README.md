# Page Object Model (POM) for testing

The Page Object Model (POM) is a design pattern that provides a structured way to interact with and retrieve information
from the user interface and world view while minimizing duplication across tests. 

For more information, see the README in the E2ETesting package 
(`Packages/eu.netherlands3d.e2e-testing/Runtime/Scripts/PageObjectModel/README.md`).
